**_1. Typefaces_**

What is meant by Typefaces?

# 
## 
No matter how good the web design may be, the text still rules the website as it **_provides_** users with **_information_**. 

- Fonts can give end-users a **_first impression_** of the website.

- It can communicate the **_purpose_** of the website **_directly_**. 

# 
## 
**Why choosing the right font(s) is important?**

- It plays a major role in how **_users perceive_** and **_interact_** with your website.

- It can **_help_** your message **_stand out clearly_** to the end-user.

- It **_adds_** to the **_aesthetic_** and **_brand feeling_** of the website. 

# 
## 
**What to consider/think about when choosing a font(s)?**

There are multiple categories of fonts available to you when designing and developing websites.

# 
## 
On most websites, however, you will find that the two major categories of fonts to choose from are **_serif_** and **_sans serif_** fonts:

- **_Serif fonts_** have **_extra decorations_**(serifs) at the end of stokes; sometimes called feet or tails.

- **_Sans serif fonts_** are without serifs; **_no extra details_** are found at the end of each letter.

# 
## 
**What is the difference between Serif and Sans Serif fonts?**

**_Serif fonts_** have been used over a long period of time:

For example, during the time of the Roman Empire, official Latin text was written with serif fonts.

# 
## 
Serif fonts give a feeling of:

- Confidence

- Traditional

- Trustworthy

- Established

# 
## 
A good fit to give websites a **_professional_**, **_reputable_**, and **_serious_** look. 

Some examples include:

- [Coach](https://uk.coach.com/)

- [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/)

- [Bedow](https://www.bedow.se/)

# 
## 
**_Sans Serif fonts_** give a feeling of:

- Clean

- Approachability

- Cool

# 
## 
The clean lines and sharp edges of serif fonts are able to render out more **_clearly_** on a screen.
A good fit to give websites a more **_modern_**, **_casual_**, and **_humanistic_** look. 

# 
## 
Some examples include:

- [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/)

- [Ace&Tate](https://www.aceandtate.com/)

- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)

# 
## 
**How to work with Typefaces?**

- Using online resources such as **_Google Fonts_** gives you access to web-safe fonts that will help when developing a site.

- The design of your site can be more **_traditional_** with only **_Serif_** fonts or more **_casual_** with **_Sans Serif_** fonts. 

- The two **_fonts_** can also be **_combined_** to create distinction in the text as well as design.

# 
## 
Whichever approach you choose to take some **_Rules of Thumb_** to consider:

- Consider using fonts that are **_easier to read_**.

- Modern **_sans-serif_** fonts can be used for **_body texts_**.

- The **_ideal_** font **_size_** for reading easily online is **_16px_**.

# 
**_2. Colors_**

What is meant by Color-Palette?

# 
## 
* A good color combination can go a long way to **_attract_** and **_retain users_** to a website.

* A user’s experience can be enhanced if the website uses **_complementary_** colors that give a balanced look. 

* A combination of vibrant and contrasting colors, as well as the proper use of white spaces, can give the edge the design and **_flow_** of a website. 

# 
## 
**How to create a good Color-Palette?**

When you pick the **_right color_** for a website, you are also creating a **_memorable brand_** for the user.

# 
## 
**Steps to consider:**

* Choose a **_Primary_** color - The dominant color of the website (usually associated with the brand of the site).

* Choose some **_Secondary_** color(s) - Accenting colors that compliment the primary color.

* Choose a **_Background_** color - The backdrop of your site that compliments both the primary and secondary colors.

# 
## 
**How to use the primary (dominant) color on your website?**

Only use in a **_limited_** number of places where you want visitors to pay attention to.

* Logo

* Menu Links

* Call-to-Action Button

* Headlines

# 
## 
**How to use the secondary (accent) color on your website?**

Use them to highlight secondary information on the website:

* Sub-heading

* Secondary Buttons

* Information Boxes

* Background Color

# 
## 
**How to choose the right background color?**

The background color of your website depends on the purpose of your website and what you want your visitors to focus on.


# 
## 
_Type 1: Content Intensive Information Websites & eCommerce Websites:_

- The best color scheme to use is a white or **_light_** background, with **_bold dominant_** & **_accent colors_**. 

- The bold dominant and accent colors give the website **_personality_** and **_focal points_**, while the plain background color keeps your visitors’ focus on your content or products.

# 
## 
_Type 2: Corporate / business websites usually have two purposes:_

- Promoting the brand 

- Promoting a service.

# 
## 
**Promoting a Brand**

When building to promote the **_brand identity_**, make use of various **_shades_** of the dominant or brand color as the background color.

When using a **_variation_** of the **_primary/dominant_** color as your background, you are **_reinforcing_** your brand and makes it more memorable to your audience.

# 
## 
**Examples:**

- [Nordic Ruby](http://www.nordicruby.org/)

- [Odopod](https://www.odopod.com/)

# 
## 
**Promoting a Service**

If the focal point the value of your service or your **_portfolio_** of past projects, use **_white_** or a **_neutral_** background color.

Just like content-intensive and eCommerce websites, you don’t want your background color to take the focus away from your content or the message you want to communicate.

# 
## 
**Examples:**

- [Scotch & Soda](https://www.scotch-soda.com/nl/nl/home)

- [Story Of Amsterdam](https://storyofams.com/)

# 
## 
_Type 3: Stylish & Creative Websites that are Graphic Intensive:_

For websites used in fashion, design, restaurant, beauty and creative industries, the world is your oyster.

There are really no rules as to what background image or colors you should use. 

# 
## 
Examples:

- [Scotch & Soda](https://www.scotch-soda.com/nl/nl/home)

# 
**_3.IMAGES_**

What type of images to use on web applications?

# 
## 
As a web designer, it’s important to know the difference between the different image formats and how to use them in each situation.

There are several types of files you can use:

- JPEG

- GIF

- PNG

- SVG

# 
## 
**_JPEG_** was developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group. It works well for **_natural image_** types (photography). 

Natural image types, like photography, have smooth variations of colors which means the JPEG format also works well for images that contain gradients and varying tones and colors.

# 
## 
An important point about JPEG’s is that they are generally a **_lossy_** format. 

Lossy compression is simply a form of encoding that discards (loses) some of it's data... which is why if you save a JPG 100 times, it will slowly become more **_deteriorated_** over time.

# 
## 
- **_Advantages_**: lightweight file, viewable on almost any program. 

- **_Disadvantages_**: loses quality when saved multiple times.

- **_Best places to use it_**: images for web design, social networks, and photo portfolios.

# 
## 
**_GIF_** (Graphics Interchange Format) was developed by CompuServe(Software company) and uses the LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) compression method, which is **_lossless_**. 

This method of compression builds a color table for the image where each color value is assigned to pixels. This compression method makes this image format ideal for line art, logos or other simple images without gradients or varying color.

# 
## 
- **_Advantages_**: supports transparency and basic animation.

- **_Disadvantages_**: displays gradient colors poorly.

- **_Best places to use it_**: short animations for social channels, like Facebook and Twitter.

# 
##  
**_PNG_** (Portable Network Graphics) was created to essentially replace, or at least improve upon the GIF format. PNG uses the DEFLATE compression method – the same algorithm used in zip and gzip, it’s a **_lossless_** compression.

Unlike JPEG files, PNGs also support images with **_transparent_** backgrounds. So, if you want to have an image without a background, like a logo or product, you can save it as a PNG file and use it with different backgrounds.

# 
## 
- **_Advantages_**: high-quality files, supports transparent backgrounds.

- **_Disadvantages_**: heavyweight file (slows down loading time and takes up lots of storage).

- **_Best places to use it_**: logos, websites photos, social networks (profile pictures, posts, and cover photos).

# 
## 
**_SVG_** (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a format that never quite caught on as a widely used image type. 

The idea behind this format is to allow for "vector graphics" on the web. The format uses XML as a basis for describing a 2D image on the web. 

# 
## 
You don’t have to be a professional photographer to use great images on your website. Every day it seems like there are more high-quality stock photo sites where you can download free photos for commercial use.

# 
## 
**How can image sizes affect site performance?**

Large images slow down your web pages which creates a less than optimal user experience. 

Optimizing images is the **_process of decreasing their file size_**, using either a plugin or script, which in turn speeds up the load time of the page. Lossy and lossless compression are two methods commonly used.
